This Coffee Shop Sales Analysis optimizes retail performance through data-driven insights. Using an interactive dashboard, I tracked $4.8K in revenue and identified peak sales between 8-10 AM. The project analyzes KPIs like average order value and top products across three store locations to enhance growth.
